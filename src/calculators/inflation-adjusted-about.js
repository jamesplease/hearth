        <p className="appParagraph">
          Due to inflation, the value of a dollar tends to decrease over time.
          Most retirement strategies involve adjusting your spending for
          inflation, which can be a difficult calculation to figure out.
        </p>
        <p className="appParagraph">
          This calculator helps you to adjust your withdrawal amount to
          counterattack the effect of inflation.
        </p>
        <h2 className="secondaryHeader">Example Usage</h2>
        <p className="appParagraph">
          Let’s say you retired in the year 2000, and you had planned to live
          off of $30,000 per year. In the year 2017, you know that $30,000 won’t
          buy you same amount of stuff on account of inflation. To keep your
          quality of life the same, you need to withdraw a larger amount of
          money.
        </p>
        <p className="appParagraph">
          You can use this calculator to find out how much you need to withdraw.
          Your Start Value is $30,000, the Start Year is 2000, and the End Year
          is 2017. Inputting these into the calculator yields the answer:
          $43,158.59.

        <h2 className="secondaryHeader">Caveats</h2>
        <p className="appParagraph">
          If you’re trying to calculate inflation for the current year, and the
          calculator prevents you from doing that, then you should use the
          previous year.
        </p>
        <p className="appParagraph">
          This is because there is sometimes a delay in getting the latest data
          from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
