        <p className="appParagraph">
          The Trinity Study popularized a method for determining the safe
          withdrawal rate for a retirement portfolio. This method involves
          looking at historical data to see how frequently the portfolio
          succeeded or failed.
        </p>
        <p className="appParagraph">
          The well known 4% rule is the result of this study. It states that for
          a portfolio comprised of mostly stocks, a withdrawal rate of 4% is
          likely to last at least as long as you do.
        </p>
        <p className="appParagraph">
          This calculator allows you to tweak the variables used in the Trinity
          Study to see how it effects the outcome.

        <h2 className="secondaryHeader">Example Usage</h2>
        <p className="appParagraph">
          Letâ€™s say you plan to retire with $700,000, and want to see how
          frequently your portfolio would have succeeded or failed with a
          withdrawal of $30,000 (which is just above 4%). Because you're
          relatively young, you're planning for a 45 year long retirement.
        </p>
        <p className="appParagraph">
          Throw these numbers into the calculator and you see the success rate:
          93.22%.
