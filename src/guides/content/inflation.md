# Inflation

Older people love sharing what life was like when they were growing
up: how far they had to walk places, or how they could buy a candy bar
with a nickel. Our abundance of cars may explain why we don't walk as
much these days, but what about those cheap candy bars? Where did they
go?

Over time, goods and services in the U.S. tend to cost more. To put it
another way, a single U.S. dollar buys less as time goes on.

The tendency for a currency to decrease in value over time is called
inflation.

## How is Inflation Computed?

The idea that a dollar becomes worth less over time may seem a little
odd. How is it possible that a dollar, which is itself an arbitrary
unit of value, could gain or lose value?

The answer to this philosophical question is decidedly mundane.
Measuring the value of the dollar is done by simply looking at how the
price of common goods and services changes from year to year.

Consider this: if a milk chocolate bar costs $1 in 2015, but in 2016
it cost $1.05 (an increase of 5%), then it could be that dairy farms
had some extra expenses in 2016 that were passed along to consumers.
Maybe there was a cow illness, so less milk was produced, driving up
the price of milk chocolate. The chocolate price increase could be
explained by the law of supply and demand.

But what if _everything_ in the United States cost 5% more in
2016 compared to 2015? When that happens, it's much less likely that
supply and demand is driving up the price. Instead, it seems more
correct to say the U.S. dollar itself has become worth less. And
that's what economists do.

Although it would be a lot of work to look at the cost of everything,
a good estimate can be found by looking at some of the most common
items that people buy to see if, on average, they cost more from year
to year.

## Who Measures These Prices?

The U.S. Federal Government does. More specifically, the Bureau of
Labor Statistics. Each year, they measure the cost of different things
and moosh them together into a number called the "consumer price
index" (CPI). The CPI represents how much all of those goods and
services cost in a given year. A higher CPI means that things were
more expensive that year. The inflation between two years is computed
by comparing their CPIs.

The CPI data is freely available from the U.S. government. You can
download it [here](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/data.htm).

If you're interested in learning more about the CPI, the Bureau of
Labor Statistics has put together
[an informative FAQ](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/questions-and-answers.htm). One
[interesting question](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/questions-and-answers.htm#Question_7)
lists the goods and services that they look at from year to year to
compute the CPI.

## Does the Dollar _Always_ Lose Value From Year to Year?

Not always. Sometimes it gains value (which over time is called
deflation), but this is less common. Between 2014 and 2015 the dollar
slightly increased in value, for instance.

## It Doesn't Feel Like the Dollar Gets Less Valuable

This is because inflation is typically small in the U.S., averaging
around 3% per year. From one year to the next, it's easy not to notice
the price of goods increasing by a few cents. However, those cents add
up over many years, which is why inflation matters when planning for
your retirement.

## Inflation for Retirement

Typical retirees plan to spend a certain amount of money each year.
For instance, you might plan on retiring on $30,000 per year. However,
because of inflation, $30,000 toward the end of a long retirement will
be able to buy a lot less stuff than it could at the start.

If you don't adjust your annual spending for inflation, then your
quality of life will steadily decrease as the dollar is able to buy
you less.

Because of this, when you're retired, you'll need to know how to
compute the inflation-adjusted value based on the CPI. If you wanted
to, you could pull the CPI from the U.S. federal government's website
above, and run the calculations by hand.

Alternatively, Hearth provides a calculator that makes things easier:
the [Inflation Calculator](/calculators/inflation-adjusted-spending). With
that calculator, you input a Start Value, a Start Year,
and an End Year. The calculator outputs how many dollars you'll need
in the End Year to be able to purchase the same amount of stuff as you
could with the Start Value in Start Year.

Here's an example: let's say you retired in the 2000 on $25,000 per
year. Adjusting for inflation, in 2017 you would need to withdraw
$35,965 to be able to purchase the same amount of stuff.

This example demonstrates the profound effect of inflation over long
time scales, and suggests that we, too, will soon be telling youngters
how cheap candy bars once were.
