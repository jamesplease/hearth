# Risk vs Volatility

There are two things you need to know about any investment that you make: how risky it is, and how volatile it is. These words are often used interchangeably when discussing investments, but there is an important distinction between the two.

## Risk

Risk is how likely it is that you will lose all of your investment. A risky investment may be if a family member asks you for $10,000 to start their business. Many small businesses fail, so if someone you know asks for money to help out with their business, then it is a risky investment. If their business fails, then you would lose your $10,000.

Even investing in a single company in the stock market is considered risky. Any one company may succeed or fail, and nobody is able to predict the future.

You may know people who pick and choose individual companies to invest in. They may have even had a few good years, and tell you that they made a good investment choice. They have been lucky; the companies could have just as easily done very bad over this same period. They are making risky investment decisions.

A common word of wisdom when investing is to have a diverse portfolio. This means that you don't invest too much in any one thing. The justification behind this strategy is that investing in many different sources reduces your overall risk.

Investing in the entire stock market provides a diverse portfolio that greatly reduces risk. The chances of every company in the stock market going out of business are low.

## Volatility

Volatility is a measure of how rapidly the value of an investment may change from day to day.

Investments in the stock market are a good example of a volatile investment. It’s a well-known fact that stock market “crashes” can occur, which is when the value of most companies in the stock market drop suddenly.

The interesting thing to keep in mind about volatility is that it doesn’t reflect the long-term trend of the investment. The stock market, on average, grows 7% year over year. This is including all of the stock market crashes.

## Dealing with Volatility

If you invest $10,000 in the stock market, you might wake up the next morning to find that it has dropped in value to $5,000. What do you do?

A savvy investor does nothing. History tells us that the stock market will occasionally crash, but it always recovers. If you leave your money in the investment, then in a few years you will get back the money you lost, and then some.

Someone who is new to investing in the stock market may get worried, and want to withdraw their money. This is a bad idea, because you will lose your $5,000 if you withdraw your money.

The investments that you put into the stock market should be for long-term use. Don’t put your rent money into the stock market, because you need to be sure that you can pay it at the end of the month.

## Conclusion

Most people want to avoid risky investments, and this is especially true for people who wish to be early retired. The last thing you want to happen is to lose all of your money!

Although the recommendations made here will never be high-risk investments, they will sometimes be volatile investments. Volatile investments can be scary, but historical performance of an investment can give you confidence that it over many years it will trend upward or downward.
