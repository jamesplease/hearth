          <p className="appParagraph">
            FIRE is an acronym that stands for "Financial Independence, Retire
            Early." It's tempting to focus on the second half of the acronym,
            but the first half is more important.
          </p>
          <p className="appParagraph">
            To be financially independent means that you don't need to work a
            regular job to pay for the expenses in your life. This means you
            could "retire," staying at home all day doing nothing, but most
            FIRE'd people choose to do more productive things with their time.
          </p>
          <p className="appParagraph">
            The thing is, doing nothing would get boring quickly! FIRE'ing is
            about being able to do the things you find most valuable or fun in
            life. This is why many FIRE'd folks emphasize the first half of the
            acronym over the second.
          </p>
          <h1 className="secondaryHeader">How does it work?</h1>
          <p className="appParagraph">
            The way it works is straightforward: once you save up enough, the
            earnings you make on your investments will cover all of your
            expenses. Of course, actually saving up the money is where the
            challenge lies.
          </p>
          <p className="appParagraph">
            Americans aren't taught to save. Instead, we're more familiar with
            the idea that the more we can buy, the happier we will be. This, in
            additions to factors such as the unreasonable cost of higher
            education, means that most Americans are in debt. To make matters
            worse, we don't do a very good job at talking about money, so people
            often feel helpless about their financial standing.
          </p>
          <p className="appParagraph">
            As a result of this, many Americans are not currently on a path to
            FIRE. The neat thing is that FIRE is an option for many of us. The
            thing holding them back is that they don't know that it exists!
          </p>
          <h1 className="secondaryHeader">This sounds impossible</h1>
          <p className="appParagraph">
            Most people don't think that FIRE'ing is possible. Or maybe it is,
            but not for them. People who feel this way will never FIRE. If this
            is you, I encourage you to open your mind for a moment and consider
            the option that maybe it is an option for you. Who knows, you might
            learn something new.
